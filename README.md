# My Portfolio
This is a repo for my portfolio website: [Portfolio GitLab Repo](https://gitlab.com/lingsin5234/portfolio)

My portfolio is created using Django along with a few key supporting python libraries:

*  django-simple-captcha
*  django-simple-menu
*  markdown

## Layout
This website is divided into the following pages:

*  Main Page
*  Resume
*  Project
*  About Me
*  Contact Me

## D3.js
The D3.js Javascript library is also used for visualization. Although there is not an abundance of data for
this project, the **Main Page** and **Resume** pages are built for future additions of projects that are
worked on.

The **Main Page** contains a grid function that lists the projects in threes, automatically aligning the last
row depending on how many projects are in the last row itself.

The **Resume** page calls on models for work experience, technical skills and education separately, thus can
be expanded on as skills and experiences are accumulated.
